## Why was ADR created?

ADR was originally created to allow members of
[Ceu Azul Aeronaves](http://www.aerodesign.ufsc.br/) to iterate
through different aircraft conceptual designs in a programmatic manner. With
time the team saw that sharing this knowledge by opening the project would
stimulate the OpenSource roots to enter the 
[SAE Aerodesign](http://portal.saebrasil.org.br/programas-estudantis/sae-brasil-aerodesign) 
competition.
