# ADR
This is Aircraft Design Resources

## Usage

You can install ADR on your computer by either using pip editable mode (explained below) or regular pip installation, where you follow the same steps but remove the `-e` from the pip command:

```sudo pip install ./```

## Contribution:
To develop the code you need to open a folder on your computer (i.e. "ADR_git") and execute the following commands (CMD with administrator rights for Windows/Terminal for Linux):

```git clone https://github.com/CeuAzul/ADR.git```

on Linux:
```sudo pip install -e ./```

on Windows:
```pip install -e ./```

From this point you will have ADR installed on your computer and will be able to edit and/or execute it from anywhere.
