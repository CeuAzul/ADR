# ADR
This is Aircraft Design Resources

## Usage

You can install ADR on your computer by either using pip editable mode (explained on Contribution) or regular pip installation, where you follow the same steps but remove the `-e` from the pip command:

```sudo pip install ./```

## Contribution:

1. Create a folder on your computer (i.e. "ADR_git")

2.  Linux:
```
git clone https://github.com/CeuAzul/ADR.git
cd ADR
sudo pip install setuptools
sudo pip install -e ./
```

2. Windows (CMD with administrator rights):
```
git clone https://github.com/CeuAzul/ADR.git
cd ADR
pip install setuptools
pip install -e ./
```
\

From this point you will have ADR installed on your computer and will be able to edit and/or execute it from anywhere.
