## Usage
For information on how to use ADR, [check our docs](https://CeuAzul.github.io/ADR).

## Development
ADR uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. You can
install poetry [with this single command](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
Poetry ensures you are developing on a separated environment and with the same
dependencies as the other developers. Once poetry is installed, follow those steps:
